# 🚀 Exciting Projects I've Worked On

## 🧠 Churn Predictive Model using Machine Learning
Ever wondered how companies predict who’s going to leave their service next? That's what I tackled with machine learning! Here’s what I did:
- **Modeling Magic**: Used Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers to set the stage for some serious number crunching.
- **Tuning Genius**: Went all out with hyperparameter tuning to boost the models’ brainpower, plus some neat tricks with precision-recall curves and ROC analysis to catch churners like a pro.

## 🔍 Blackbox Testing
Peek into the blackbox! I dived deep into the guts of AVL trees and std::maps to see which one stands tall:
- **Automation for the Win**: Set up an automaed testing arena to watch these data structures duke it out, providing crystal-clear reports on their performance.
- **Quality Check**: Used tools for visual validation and hunted down memory leaks, making sure everything's running smooth and steady.
- **Team Play**: Kept the team in the loop with regular updates, because transparency is key!

## 🕸️ Selenium Webpage Testing 
When real estate meets tech, you get my Selenium testing project! Here's the scoop:
- **Bug Hunter**: Led a squadron of automated tests on a web application, tackling bugs and boosting the product’s quality across functional, performance, scalability, and stress tests.
- **Scripting Master**: Crafted robust test scripts that mimic real user interactions, uncovering hidden issues and zapping them!
- **Doc Guru**: Wrote crystal-clear documentation to make life easier for both users and fellow devs.
